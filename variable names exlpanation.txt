Variable names explanation:

htrnr - heat flux [W/m2]
htvat - heat structure temperature [K]
p - pressure [Pa], normalized against pressure at inlet
sattemp - saturation temperature [K]
tempf - temperature of fluid [K], normalized against temperature at inlet
tempg - temperature of has [K], normalized against temperature at inlet
vapgen - vapour generation rate [kg/(m3*s)]
velf - average velocity of liquid volume [m/s]
velg - average velocity of vapor volume [m/s]

velf seems to be an unstable parameter, varying widely from timestep to timestep

Explanation of file-naming scheme:

example - 50_50_15_0_0_80_2000 translates to:

first five parameters describe primary side
50 Bar, 50 K superheat over boiling temperature related to 50 Bar, 15 kg/h mass flow, 0% of He in the non condensable mixture (relation of He to N2),  0 kg/h of NC mixture in the flow

last two describe secondary flow:
80 K subcoolling under boiling temperature in primary side, 2000 kg/h mass flow
